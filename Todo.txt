* How to form process in HTML? if that HTML was an output from a PHP file. Ex, laptoplist4request.php will return a dynamically buit form...now how will dashboard.html has to process as to find which laptop was requested?
* Do Field level validation
* Give a professional appeal using CSS. Require site logo ie the one displays on browser tab. Requires Trivent Logo.
* Avoid page redirection using hardcoded values....deployment will be difficult
* Create user creation pages and do password hashing.
* on a 2nd thought, give user registration page instead of user creation page
* Make use of Stored Procedures for back end insert etc especially to record the requested Laptop
* Make use of JSON for data exchange between JS and PHP
* Requires pagenation for presenting list of available laptops in the request laptop page
* Try using Jquery instead of low level programming
* Once a laptop is requested , it should not appear in the Request list
* Request Laptop button should be greyed out ie it should not be clicable if the user has already requested a laptop
* If a loged in user has pending laptop request then the REQUEST button should not be enabled
* Do we have to record reason for rejection of laptops?
* Develop a marketing collateral speaking about the benefits of using the system and sell as recurring monthly service

Done
